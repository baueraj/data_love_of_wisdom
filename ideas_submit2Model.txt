Truth is a matter of asserting correct combinations and separations
Simple and essential truth seems to be given, with further truth arising in thinking
Truth is either intuiting a way of being, or a putting together
The concept of truth was originated by the senses

Anselm of Canterbury identified truth with God
Types of lying: Speak lies, intend lies, intend deception, aim at deceptive goal?
Truth is its own standard
The predicate is in the subject of a true proposition
Truth consists of having the same idea about something that God has
Truth is a property of a belief, but dependent on its external relations, not its internal qualities

Putnam's epistemic notion of truth replaces the realism of correspondence with ontological relativism
It is part of the concept of truth that we aim at making true statements
A sentence is held true because of a combination of meaning and belief
Rules of reasoning precede the concept of truth, and they are what characterize it
The function of the truth predicate? Understanding 'true'? Meaning of 'true'? The concept of truth? A theory of truth?
A true proposition is consistent with every other true proposition
To say a relative truth is inexpressible in other frameworks is 'weak', while saying it is false is 'strong'
The epistemic theory of truth presents it as 'that which is licensed by our best theory of reality'
Some truths have true negations
Truth is a property, because the truth predicate has an extension
Semantic theories of truth seek models; axiomatic (syntactic) theories seek logical principles
A truth is just a proposition in which the predicate is contained within the subject
Truth-value 'gluts' allow two truth values together; 'gaps' give a partial conception of truth
Truth axioms prove objects exist, so truth doesn't seem to be a logical notion
The idea that there are unrecognised truths is basic to our concept of truth
Jesus said he bore witness to the truth.  Pilate asked, What is truth?
Truth is such a transcendentally clear notion that it cannot be further defined
Superficial truth is knowing how something is, which is consciousness of bare correctness
Genuine truth is the resolution of the highest contradiction
Kierkegaard's truth draws on authenticity, fidelity and honesty
The word 'true' seems to be unique and indefinable
You can only define a statement that something is 'true' by referring to its functional possibilities
Tarski proved that truth cannot be defined from within a given theory
Tarski proved that any reasonably expressive language suffers from the liar paradox
'True sentence' has no use consistent with logic and ordinary language, so definition seems hopeless
In everyday language, truth seems indefinable, inconsistent, and illogical
Definitions of truth should not introduce a new version of the concept, but capture the old one
A definition of truth should be materially adequate and formally correct
A rigorous definition of truth is only possible in an exactly specified language
We may eventually need to split the word 'true' into several less ambiguous terms
There is no theory of truth, because it isn't a concept
We must be able to specify truths in a precise language, like winning moves in a game
A comprehensive theory of truth probably includes a theory of predication
Defining truth presupposes that there can be a true definition
If truths are just identical with facts, then truths will make themselves true
We might define truth as arising from the truth-maker relation
Truth has no 'nature', but we should try to describe its behaviour in inferences
Truth definitions don't produce a good theory, because they go beyond your current language
Traditional definitions of truth often make it more obscure, rather than less
Any definition of truth requires a metalanguage
If people have big doubts about truth, a definition might give it more credibility
If we define truth, we can eliminate it
Truth has the supreme value, for both gods and men
Piety requires us to honour truth above our friends
Falsehoods corrupt a mind, producing passions and instability
For the mind Good is one truth among many, and Truth is one good among many
Virtue is the distinctive mark of truth, and its greatest product
Spinoza's life shows that love of truth which he proclaims as the highest value
Nothing is so beautiful to the eye as truth is to the mind
If man sacrifices truth he sacrifices himself, by acting against his own convictions
What I hold true must also be part of my feelings and character
Truth forges an impersonal unity between people
Pure truth is for infinite beings only; I prefer endless striving for truth
Truth finds fewest champions not when it is dangerous, but when it is boring
Why should truth be omnipotent? It is enough that it is very powerful
Why do we want truth, rather than falsehood or ignorance? The value of truth is a problem
Truth was given value by morality, but eventually turned against its own source
One must never ask whether truth is useful
Antirealism about truth prevents its use as an intersubjective standard
Speak truth only to those who deserve the truth
Careful evasions of truth at least show respect for it
We don't care about plain truth, but truth in joint-carving terms
Like animals, we seek truth because we want safety
'Truth' is the will to be master over the multiplicity of sensations
Truth is what unites, and the profound truths create a community
'Truth' is the procedures for controlling which statements are acceptable
Truth is a method of deducing facts from propositions
The notion of truth is to help us make use of the utterances of others
Truth relates truthbearers to truthmakers
'True of' is applicable to things, while 'true' is applicable to words
The truth bearers are said to be the signified, or the signifier, or the meaning of the signifier
It is only when we say a proposition that we speak truly or falsely
It is propositions which are true or false, though it is sometimes said of ideas
If they refer to real substances, 'man' is a true idea and 'centaur' a false one
Truth only belongs to mental or verbal propositions
Truth is a characteristic of possible thoughts
True and false seem to pertain to thoughts, yet unthought propositions seem to be true or false
In Hegel's logic it is concepts (rather than judgements or propositions) which are true or false
Frege was strongly in favour of taking truth to attach to propositions
What is true or false is not mental, and is best called 'propositions'
Truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs and statements
In its primary and formal sense, 'true' applies to propositions, not beliefs
Truth belongs to beliefs, not to propositions and sentences
Truth is irrelevant if no statements are involved
Must sentences make statements to qualify for truth?
Davidson takes truth to attach to individual sentences
Are the truth-bearers sentences, utterances, ideas, beliefs, judgements, propositions or statements?
Logicians take sentences to be truth-bearers for rigour, rather than for philosophical reasons
To be true a sentence must express a proposition, and not be ambiguous or vague or just expressive
Psychology has to include the idea that mental processes are typically truth-preserving
There are at least fourteen candidates for truth-bearers
A statement S is 'partly true' if it has some wholly true parts
Truth and falsity apply to suppositions as well as to assertions
Are truth-bearers propositions, or ideas/beliefs, or sentences/utterances?
Propositions have sentence-like structures, so it matters little which bears the truth
If one error is worse than another, it must be because it is further from the truth
The one unpardonable offence is reasoning is blocking the route to further truth
Theories generate infinite truths and falsehoods, so they cannot be used to assess probability
More truthful theories have greater predictive power
Verisimilitude might be explained as being close to the possible world where the truth is exact
Verisimilitude has proved hard to analyse, and seems to have several components
Verisimilitude comes from including more phenomena, and revealing what underlies
In the deeper sense of truth, to be untrue resembles being bad; badness is untrue to a thing's nature
To love truth, you must know how to lie
Only because there is thought is there untruth
A good theory of truth must make falsehood possible
Asserting not-p is saying p is false
True and false are not symmetrical; false is more complex, involving negation
Observation and applied thought are always true
Truth is clear and distinct conception - of which it is hard to be sure
My general rule is that everything that I perceive clearly and distinctly is true
Someone may think a thing is 'clear and distinct', but be wrong
For Spinoza, 'adequacy' is the intrinsic mark of truth
We hold a proposition true if we are ready to follow it, and can't see any objections
Choose the true hypothesis, which is the most intelligible one
I recognise knowledge, but it is the truth by which I can live and die that really matters
Subjective truth can only be sustained by repetition
Traditional views of truth are tautologies, and truth is empty without a subject
The highest truth we can get is uncertainty held fast by an inward passion
True beliefs are those which augment one's power
'Epistemic' truth depends what rational creatures can verify
Anti-realist see truth as our servant, and epistemically contrained
If the existence of truth is denied, the 'Truth does not exist' must be true!
The truth is what gives us the minimum of spiritual effort, and avoids the exhaustion of lying
Truth is just a name for verification-processes
Heidegger says truth is historical, and never absolute
Truth is just an error insufficiently experienced
Eventually every 'truth' is guaranteed by the police
Truth doesn't arise from solitary freedom, but from societies with constraints
Derrida says that all truth-talk is merely metaphor
True thoughts are inaccessible, in the subconscious, prior to speech or writing
Rorty seems to view truth as simply being able to hold one's view against all comers
In the early 1930s many philosophers thought truth was not scientific
Truth-thinking does not make it so; it being so is what makes it true
The truth or falsehood of a belief depends upon a fact to which the belief 'refers'
We want to know what makes sentences true, rather than defining 'true'
Philosophers of the past took the truthmaking idea for granted
Truth and falsehood must track what does or doesn't exist
Phenomenalists, behaviourists and presentists can't supply credible truth-makers
There are five problems which the truth-maker theory might solve
The truth-maker idea is usually justified by its explanatory power, or intuitive appeal
The best account of truth-making is isomorphism
Truthmakers are about existential grounding, not about truth
Part-whole is the key relation among truth-makers
Maybe truth-making is an unanalysable primitive, but we can specify principles for it
Propositions are made true, in virtue of something which explains its truth
Examples show that truth-making is just non-symmetric, not asymmetric
A ground must be about its truth, and not just necessitate it
If truthmaking is classical entailment, then anything whatsoever makes a necessary truth
Moral realism doesn't seem to entail the existence of any things
Truth-maker theory can't cope with non-causal dependence
The truth-making relation can be one-to-one, or many-to-many
Truths need not always have their source in what exists
Not all truths need truthmakers - mathematics and logic seem to be just true
'Maximalism' says every truth has an actual truthmaker
Maximalism follows Russell, and optimalism (no negative or universal truthmakers) follows Wittgenstein
Surely if some propositions are grounded in existence, they all are?
If maximalism is necessary, then that nothing exists has a truthmaker, which it can't have
The truth-maker principle is that every truth has a sufficient truth-maker
Central idea: truths need truthmakers; and possibly all truths have them, and makers entail truths
Maybe only 'positive' truths need truth-makers
Truth-making can't be entailment, because truthmakers are portions of reality
Armstrong says truthmakers necessitate their truth, where 'necessitate' is a primitive relation
Something can only have a place in a preferred account of things if it is entailed by the account
God might necessitate that something happen, but He is not the truth-maker for it
The view that truth making is entailment is misguided and misleading
It is assumed that a proposition is necessarily true if its truth-maker exists
Orthodox Truthmaker applies to all propositions, and necessitates their truth
God fixes all the truths of the world by fixing what exists
Give up objects necessitating truths, and say their natures cause the truths?
Determinate truths don't need extra truthmakers, just truthmakers that are themselves determinate
Most theorists say that truth-makers necessitate their truths
The truth or falsity of a belief will be in terms of something that is always this way not that
Facts make propositions true or false, and are expressed by whole sentences
Truthmakers are facts 'of' a domain, not something 'in' the domain
We might use 'facta' to refer to the truth-makers for facts
Predications aren't truth because of what exists, but of how it exists
Moments (objects which cannot exist alone) may serve as truth-makers
The truth-maker for a sentence may not be unique, or may be a combination, or several separate items
Truth-makers cannot be the designata of the sentences they make true
Despite negative propositions, truthmakers are not logical complexes, but ordinary experiences
Some sentences depend for their truth on worldly circumstances, and others do not
Two different propositions can have the same fact as truth-maker
Truthmaker needs truths to be 'about' something, and that is often unclear
The main idea of truth-making is that what a proposition is about is what matters
What the proposition says may not be its truthmaker
Rather than what exists, some claim that the truthmakers are ways of existence, dispositions, modalities etc
Truthmaking doesn't require realism, because we can be anti-realist about truthmakers
The facts about the existence of truthmakers can't have a further explanation
It seems best to assume different kinds of truth-maker, such as objects, facts, tropes, or events
If facts are the truthmakers, they are not in the world
There are no 'falsifying' facts, only an absence of truthmakers
A truthmaker is the minimal portion of reality that will do the job
A true existence statement has its truth caused by the existence of the thing
The truthmaker principle requires some specific named thing to make the difference
What matters is truth-making (not truth-makers)
Orthodox truthmaker theories make entities fundamental, but that is poor for explanation
If a ball changes from red to white, Truthmaker says some thing must make the change true
Truthmaker says if an entity is removed, some nonexistence truthmaker must replace it
If Truthmaker says each truth is made by the existence of something, the theory had de re modality at is core
A truthmaker is an object which entails a sentence
We need to grasp not number-objects, but the states of affairs which make number statements true
Truthmaker demands not just a predication, but an existing state of affairs with essential ingredients
Truthmaker requires a commitment to tropes or states of affairs, for contingent truths
Truth-makers seem to be states of affairs (plus optional individuals), or individuals and properties
Truth supervenes on being
Say 'truth is supervenient on being', but construe 'being' broadly
The weaker version of Truthmaker: 'truth supervenes on being'
If 'truth supervenes on being', worlds with the same entities, properties and relations have the same truths
If truth supervenes on being, that won't explain why truth depends on being
'Truth supervenes on being' avoids entities as truth-makers for negative truths
'Truth supervenes on being' only gives necessary (not sufficient) conditions for contingent truths
It seems that when a proposition is false, something must fail to subsist
Negative existentials have 'totality facts' as truthmakers
Negative truths have as truthmakers all states of affairs relevant to the truth
The nature of arctic animals is truthmaker for the absence of penguins there
If it were true that nothing at all existed, would that have a truthmaker?
If nothing exists, no truthmakers could make 'Nothing exists' true
It is implausible that claims about non-existence are about existing things
There aren't enough positive states out there to support all the negative truths
There are different types of truthmakers for different types of negative truth
Without truthmakers, negative truths must be ungrounded
One truthmaker will do for a contingent truth and for its contradictory
What is the truthmaker for 'it is possible that there could have been nothing'?
The truthmakers for possible unicorns are the elements in their combination
In mathematics, truthmakers are possible instantiations of structures
If the truth-making relation is modal, then modal truths will be grounded in anything
Necessary truths seem to all have the same truth-maker
The converse Barcan formula will not allow contingent truths to have truthmakers
Truthmaker is incompatible with modal semantics of varying domains
Maybe a truth-maker also works for the entailments of the given truth
'True at a possibility' means necessarily true if what is said had obtained
Not only atomic truths, but also general and negative truths, have truth-makers
Necessitating general truthmakers must also specify their limits
Optimalists say that negative and universal are true 'by default' from the positive truths
Presentism says only the present exists, so there is nothing for tensed truths to supervene on
The Truthmaker thesis spells trouble for presentists
The present property 'having been F' says nothing about a thing's intrinsic nature
One temporal distibution property grounds our present and past truths
We don't want present truthmakers for the past, if they are about to cease to exist!
Presentism has the problem that if Socrates ceases to exist, so do propositions about him
It is necessary that either a sea-fight occurs tomorrow or it doesn't, though neither option is in itself necessary
The causes of future true events must exist now, so they will happen because of destiny
Future events are true if one day we will say 'this event is happening now'
We say future things are true that will possess actuality at some following time
In the tenseless view, all times are equally real, so statements of the future have truth-values
All truths have truth-makers, but only atomic truths correspond to them
Truthmaker is correspondence, but without the requirement to be one-to-one
Correspondence is symmetric, while truth-making is taken to be asymmetric
Correspondence is an over-ambitious attempt to explain truth-making
Correspondence theorists see facts as the only truth-makers
Truthmaker isn't the correspondence theory, because it offers no analysis of truth
The vagueness of truthmaker claims makes it easier to run anti-realist arguments
Maybe truthmaking and correspondence stand together, and are interdefinable
I support the correspondence theory because I believe in truthmakers
Truth-making is usually internalist, but the correspondence theory is externalist
Unlike correspondence, truthmaking can be one truth to many truthmakers, or vice versa
Saying truths fit experience adds nothing to truth; nothing makes sentences true
Slingshot Argument: seems to prove that all sentences have the same truth-maker
Which toothbrush is the truthmaker for 'buy one, get one free'?
Truthmaker has problems with generalisation, non-existence claims, and property instantiations
Speculations about non-existent things are not about existent things, so Truthmaker is false
I am a truthmaker for 'that a human exists', but is it about me?
'Mickey Mouse is a fictional mouse' is true without a truthmaker
Does 'this sentence has no truth-maker' have a truth-maker. Reductio suggests it can't have
Even idealists could accept truthmakers, as mind-dependent
Maybe 'makes true' is not an active verb, but just a formal connective like 'because'?
Truthmaker talk of 'something' making sentences true, which presupposes objectual quantification
Truthmakers for existence is fine; otherwise maybe restrict it to synthetic truths?
Maybe analytic truths do not require truth-makers, as they place no demands on the world
What is the truthmaker for a possible new power?
For idealists reality is like a collection of beliefs, so truths and truthmakers are not distinct
Truths say of what is that it is, falsehoods say of what is that it is not
A statement is true if all the data are in harmony with it
Statements are true according to how things actually are
Falsity says that which is isn't, and that which isn't is;  truth says that which is is, and that which isn't isn't
Aristotle's truth formulation concerns referring parts of sentences, not sentences as wholes
Truth is the conformity of being to intellect
A proposition is true if its subject and predicate stand for the same thing
A true idea must correspond with its ideate or object
Truth is correspondence between mental propositions and what they are about
We must presuppose that truth is agreement of cognition with its objects
The deeper sense of truth is a thing matching the idea of what it ought to be
For Russell, both propositions and facts are arrangements of objects, so obviously they correspond
Truth as congruence may work for complex beliefs, but not for simple beliefs about existence
Beliefs are true if they have corresponding facts, and false if they don't
Propositions of existence, generalities, disjunctions and hypotheticals make correspondence tricky
Wittgenstein's picture theory is the best version of the correspondence theory of truth
Language is [propositions-elementary propositions-names]; reality is [facts-states of affairs-objects]
The account of truth in the 'Tractatus' seems a perfect example of the correspondence theory
Pictures reach out to or feel reality, touching at the edges, correlating in its parts
All thought has the logical form of reality
Science is sympathetic to truth as correspondence, since it depends on observation
True sentences says the appropriate descriptive thing on the appropriate demonstrative occasion
Correspondence may be one-many or many one, as when either p or q make 'p or q' true
We need the correspondence theory of truth to understand language and science
Before Kant, all philosophers had a correspondence theory of truth
Beliefs must match facts, but also words must match beliefs
Names, descriptions and predicates refer to things; without that, language and thought are baffling
Correspondence to the facts HAS to be the aim of enquiry
Truth has to be correspondence to facts, and a match between relations of ideas and relations in the world
Some correspondence theories concern facts; others are built up through reference and satisfaction
Correspondence theory likes ideal languages, that reveal the structure of propositions
Correspondence could be with other beliefs, rather than external facts
Correspondence theories assume that truth is a representation relation
Graspable presentations are criteria of facts, and are molded according to their objects
A true proposition seems true of one fact, but a false proposition seems true of nothing at all.
The fact which is stated by a true sentence is not something in the world
Facts aren't exactly true statements, but they are what those statements say
Facts can't make claims true, because they are true claims
Tarski showed how we could have a correspondence theory of truth, without using 'facts'
Maybe facts are just true propositions
One proposition can be made true by many different facts
What makes a disjunction true is simpler than the disjunctive fact it names
The redundancy theory gets rid of facts, for 'it is a fact that p' just means 'p'
Modern correspondence is said to be with the facts, not with true propositions
Instead of correspondence of proposition to fact, look at correspondence of its parts
How could you ever know that the presentation is similar to the object?
There cannot be complete correspondence, because ideas and reality are quite different
In many cases there is no obvious way in which ideas can agree with their object
Tarski's Theorem renders any precise version of correspondence impossible
Two maps might correspond to one another, but they are only 'true' of the country they show
Correspondence theorists shouldn't think that a country has just one accurate map
Correspondence between concepts and unconceptualised reality is impossible
The correspondence theory is wrong, because there is no one correspondence between reality and fact
Correspondence theories can't tell you what truths correspond to
There is nothng interesting or instructive for truths to correspond to
Two sentences can be rephrased by equivalent substitutions to correspond to the same thing
The Slingshot assumes substitutions give logical equivalence, and thus identical correspondence
Logical truth seems much less likely to 'correspond to the facts' than factual truth does
Correspondence has to invoke facts or states of affairs, just to serve as truth-makers
The correspondence theory also has the problem that two sets of propositions might fit the facts equally well
The common-sense theory of correspondence has never been worked out satisfactorily
The only way to specify the corresponding fact is asserting the sentence
If something is described in two different ways, is that two facts, or one fact presented in two ways?
'Snow does not fall' corresponds to snow does fall
The idea of truth is built into the idea of correspondence
One-to-one correspondence would need countable, individuable items
Correspondence to the facts is a bad account of analytic truth
We can't explain the corresponding structure of the world except by referring to our thoughts
If the correspondence theory is right, then necessary truths must correspond to something
Being true is not a relation, it is a primitive monadic property
The correspondence 'theory' is too vague - about both 'correspondence' and 'facts'
All items of possible human knowledge are interconnected, and can be reached by inference
Everything in the universe is interconnected, so potentially a mind could know everything
The true is the whole
Judgements can't be true and known in isolation; the only surety is in connections and relations
Ideas are true in so far as they co-ordinate our experiences
New opinions count as 'true' if they are assimilated to an individual's current beliefs
The coherence theory says falsehood is failure to cohere, and truth is fitting into a complete system of Truth
Coherence tests for truth without implying correspondence, so truth is not correspondence
Coherence with a set of propositions suggests we can know the proposition corresponds
Coherence truth says a consistent set of sentences is true - which ties truth to belief
Rescher says that if coherence requires mutual entailment, this leads to massive logical redundancy
If one theory is held to be true, all the other theories appear false, because they can't be added to the true one
Justification needs coherence, while truth might be ideal coherence
Coherence needs positive links, not just absence of conflict
Truth in a scenario is the negation with that scenario being a priori incoherent
The coherence theory says truth is an internal relationship between groups of truth-bearers
The coherence theory says truth is coherence of thoughts, and not about objects
Two propositions could be consistent with your set, but inconsistent with one another
Coherence theories differ over the coherence relation, and the set of proposition with which to cohere
Coherence with actual beliefs, or our best beliefs, or ultimate ideal beliefs?
Coherent truth is not with an arbitrary set of beliefs, but with a set which people actually do believe
If we suspend the law of contradiction, nothing will appear to be incoherent
Coherence is not the meaning of truth, but an important test for truth
More than one coherent body of beliefs seems possible
Even with a tight account of coherence, there is always the possibility of more than one set of coherent propositions
The coherence theory of truth implies idealism, because facts are just coherent beliefs
Any coherent set of beliefs can be made more coherent by adding some false beliefs
The coherence theory allows multiple coherent wholes, which could contradict one another
How do you identify the best coherence set; and aren't there truths which don't cohere?
Delusion and truth differ in their life functions
Truth is the opinion fated to be ultimately agreed by all investigators
Pragmatic 'truth' is a term to cover the many varied aims of enquiry
Peirce did not think a belief was true if it was useful
If truth is the end of enquiry, what if it never ends, or ends prematurely?
'Holding for true' is either practical commitment, or provisional theory
Peirce's theory offers anti-realist verificationism, but surely how things are is independent of us?
Independent truth (if there is any) is the ultimate result of sufficient enquiry
True ideas are those we can assimilate, validate, corroborate and verify (and false otherwise)
Truth is rational acceptability
Truth is an idealisation of rational acceptability
For James truth is "what it is better for us to believe" rather than a correct picture of reality
The pragmatist does not really have a theory of truth
Radical pragmatists abandon the notion of truth
The pragmatic theory of truth is relative; useful for group A can be useless for group B
Does the pragmatic theory of meaning support objective truth, or make it impossible?
For pragmatists the loftiest idea of truth is just a feature of what remains forever assertible
'True' is used for emphasis, clarity, assertion, comparison, objectivity, meaning, negation, consequence...
Truth makes disagreements matter, or worth settling
'That's true' doesn't just refer back to a sentence, but implies sustained evidence for it
Truth isn't a grand elusive property, if it is just the aim of our assertions and inquiries
Truth is proper assertion, but that has varying standards
Prior to Gödel we thought truth in mathematics consisted in provability
Tarski gave up on the essence of truth, and asked how truth is used, or how it functions
Tarski did not just aim at a definition; he also offered an adequacy criterion for any truth definition
Tarski enumerates cases of truth, so it can't be applied to new words or languages
Tarski define truths by giving the extension of the predicate, rather than the meaning
Tarski made truth relative, by only defining truth within some given artificial language
Tarski has to avoid stating how truths relate to states of affairs
Tarskian semantics says that a sentence is true iff it is satisfied by every sequence
'"It is snowing" is true if and only if it is snowing' is a partial definition of the concept of truth
It is convenient to attach 'true' to sentences, and hence the language must be specified
In the classical concept of truth, 'snow is white' is true if snow is white
Each interpreted T-sentence is a partial definition of truth; the whole definition is their conjunction
Use 'true' so that all T-sentences can be asserted, and the definition will then be 'adequate'
Scheme (T) is not a definition of truth
We don't give conditions for asserting 'snow is white'; just that assertion implies 'snow is white' is true
The statement that it is raining perfectly fits the fact that it is raining
For scientific purposes there is a precise concept of 'true-in-L', using set theory
The same sentence could be true in one language and meaningless in another, so truth is language-relative
Tarski reduced truth to reference or denotation
Tarski really explained truth in terms of denoting, predicating and satisfied functions
Truth rests on Elimination ('A' is true → A) and Introduction (A → 'A' is true)
Tarskians distinguish truth from falsehood by relations between members of sets
Tarski Bi-conditional: if you'll assert φ you'll assert φ-is-true - and also vice versa
Tarski's hierarchy lacks uniform truth, and depends on contingent factors
Disquotation is bivalent
Disquotationalism resembles a telephone directory
Disquotations says truth is assertion, and assertion proclaims truth - but what is 'assertion'?
An argument 'satisfies' a function φx if φa is true
Truth only applies to closed formulas, but we need satisfaction of open formulas to define it
Tarski uses sentential functions; truly assigning the objects to variables is what satisfies them
We can define the truth predicate using 'true of' (satisfaction) for variables and some objects
For physicalism, reduce truth to satisfaction, then define satisfaction as physical-plus-logic
Insight: don't use truth, use a property which can be compositional in complex quantified sentence
Tarski gave axioms for satisfaction, then derived its explicit definition, which led to defining truth
The best truth definition involves other semantic notions, like satisfaction (relating terms and objects)
Specify satisfaction for simple sentences, then compounds; true sentences are satisfied by all objects
Satisfaction is a sort of reference, so maybe we can define truth in terms of reference?
We can explain truth in terms of satisfaction - but also explain satisfaction in terms of truth
Axioms spell out sentence satisfaction. With no free variables, all sequences satisfy the truths
Tarski just reduced truth to some other undefined semantic notions
A 'sequence' of objects is an order set of them
If one sequence satisfies a sentence, they all do
Truth for sentences is satisfaction of formulae; for sentences, either all sequences satisfy it (true) or none do
Satisfaction is 'truth in a model', which is a model of 'truth'
If a language cannot name all objects, then satisfaction must be used, instead of unary truth
We can't use a semantically closed language, or ditch our logic, so a meta-language is needed
The metalanguage must contain the object language, logic, and defined semantics
'Snow is white' depends on meaning; whether snow is white depends on snow
Semantic theories have a regress problem in describing truth in the languages for the models
In semantic theories of truth, the predicate is in an object-language, and the definition in a metalanguage
Semantic theories avoid Tarski's Theorem by sticking to a sublanguage
Semantic theories need a powerful metalanguage, typically including set theory
Tarski defined truth for particular languages, but didn't define it across languages
Tarski made truth respectable, by proving that it could be defined
Tarski didn't capture the notion of an adequate truth definition, as Convention T won't prove non-contradiction
Tarski had a theory of truth, and a theory of theories of truth
Tarski's 'truth' is a precise relation between the language and its semantics
Tarskian truth neglects the atomic sentences
Tarski says that his semantic theory of truth is completely neutral about all metaphysics
Physicalists should explain reference nonsemantically, rather than getting rid of it
A physicalist account must add primitive reference to Tarski's theory
If listing equivalences is a reduction of truth, witchcraft is just a list of witch-victim pairs
Talk of 'truth' when sentences are mentioned; it reminds us that reality is the point of sentences
The word 'true' always refers to a possible statement
In Tarski's definition, you understand 'true' if you accept the notions of the object language
Tarski has given a correct account of the formal logic of 'true', but there is more to the concept
Only Tarski has found a way to define 'true'
Semantic notions do not occur in Tarski's definitions, but assessing their correctness involves translation
Tarski's truth is like rules for winning games, without saying what 'winning' means
Truth is part of semantics, since valid inference preserves truth
The semantic theory requires sentences as truth-bearers, not propositions
What does 'true in English' mean?
Many say that Tarski's definitions fail to connect truth to meaning
Tarski does not tell us what his various truth predicates have in common
Truth is the basic concept, because Convention-T is agreed to fix the truths of a language
To define a class of true sentences is to stipulate a possible language
Kripke's semantic theory has actually inspired promising axiomatic theories
Kripke offers a semantic theory of truth (involving models)
Truth in a model is more tractable than the general notion of truth
Truth is quite different in interpreted set theory and in the skeleton of its language
If we define truth by listing the satisfactions, the supply of predicates must be finite
A weakened classical language can contain its own truth predicate
A first-order language has an infinity of T-sentences, which cannot add up to a definition of truth
While true-in-a-model seems relative, true-in-all-models seems not to be
'Snow is white' only contingently expresses the proposition that snow is white
Disquotational truth theories are short of deductive power
The T-sentences are deductively weak, and also not deductively conservative
Ockham had an early axiomatic account of truth
If axioms and their implications have no contradictions, they pass my criterion of truth and existence
Tarski's had the first axiomatic theory of truth that was minimally adequate
Tarski defined truth, but an axiomatisation can be extracted from his inductive clauses
Tarski thought axiomatic truth was too contingent, and in danger of inconsistencies
We need an undefined term 'true' in the meta-language, specified by axioms
Certain three-valued languages can contain their own truth predicates
The Tarskian move to a metalanguage may not be essential for truth theories
We can get a substantive account of Tarski's truth by adding primitive 'true' to the object language
'Reflexive' truth theories allow iterations (it is T that it is T that p)
Axiomatic approaches to truth avoid the regress problem of semantic theories
The Naïve Theory takes the bi-conditionals as axioms, but it is inconsistent, and allows the Liar
Axiomatic theories take truth as primitive, and propose some laws of truth as axioms
A good theory of truth must be compositional (as well as deriving biconditionals)
By adding truth to Peano Arithmetic we increase its power, so truth has mathematical content!
An axiomatic theory needs to be of maximal strength, while being natural and sound
Axiomatic approaches avoid limiting definitions to avoid the truth predicate, and limited sizes of models
Axiomatic theories of truth need a weak logical framework, and not a strong metatheory
Instead of a truth definition, add a primitive truth predicate, and axioms for how it works
Should axiomatic truth be 'conservative' - not proving anything apart from implications of the axioms?
If truth is defined it can be eliminated, whereas axiomatic truth has various commitments
Axiomatic truth doesn't presuppose a truth-definition, though it could admit it at a later stage
The main semantic theories of truth are Kripke's theory, and revisions semantics
Gödel numbering means a theory of truth can use Peano Arithmetic as its base theory
Truth axioms need a base theory, because that is where truth issues arise
We know a complete axiomatisation of truth is not feasible
To axiomatise Tarski's truth definition, we need a binary predicate for his 'satisfaction'
A theory is 'conservative' if it adds no new theorems to its base theory
The Tarski Biconditional theory TB is Peano Arithmetic, plus truth, plus all Tarski bi-conditionals
Compositional Truth CT has the truth of a sentence depending of the semantic values of its constituents
CT proves PA consistent, which PA can't do on its own, so CT is not conservative over PA
Theories of truth are 'typed' (truth can't apply to sentences containing 'true'), or 'type-free'
A natural theory of truth plays the role of reflection principles, establishing arithmetic's soundness
If deflationary truth is not explanatory, truth axioms should be 'conservative', proving nothing new
Friedman-Sheard theory keeps classical logic and aims for maximum strength
Friedman-Sheard is type-free Compositional Truth, with two inference rules for truth
The FS axioms use classical logical, but are not fully consistent
Kripke classified fixed points, and illuminated their use for clarifications
Kripke-Feferman has truth gaps, instead of classical logic, and aims for maximum strength
Kripke-Feferman theory KF axiomatises Kripke fixed-points, with Strong Kleene logic with gluts
The KF is much stronger deductively that FS, which relies on classical truth
The KF theory is useful, but it is not a theory containing its own truth predicate
KF is formulated in classical logic, but describes non-classical truth, which allows truth-value gluts
That a judgement is true and that we judge it true are quite different things
The property of truth in 'It is true that I smell violets' adds nothing to 'I smell violets'
"The death of Caesar is true" is not the same proposition as "Caesar died"
"It is true that x" means no more than x
Truth can't be eliminated from universal claims, or from particular unspecified claims
'It is true that this follows' means simply: this follows
Truth is redundant for single sentences; we do better to simply speak the sentence
Asserting the truth of an indexical statement is not the same as uttering the statement
Truth is basic and clear, so don't try to replace it with something simpler
The redundancy theory cannot explain inferences from 'what x said is true' and 'x said p', to p
Truth is dispensable, by replacing truth claims with the sentence itself
'It's true that Fido is a dog' conjures up a contrast class, of 'it's false' or 'it's unlikely'
The redundancy theory conflates metalinguistic bivalence with object-language excluded middle
True and false statements can use exactly the same words
Semantics is a very modest discipline which solves no real problems
We cannot analyse the concept of 'truth', because it is simply a mark that a sentence is asserted
'Truth' may only apply within a theory
Tarski is not a disquotationalist, because you can assign truth to a sentence you can't quote
We need the concept of truth for defeasible reasoning
No deflationary conception of truth does justice to the fact that we aim for truth
The deflationary picture says believing a theory true is a trivial step after believing the theory
Truth is a useful concept for unarticulated propositions and generalisations about them
'True' is only occasionally useful, as in 'everything Fermat believed was true'
Deflationism seems to block philosophers' main occupation, asking metatheoretical questions
Deflationism cannot explain why we hold beliefs for reasons
Deflationism just says there is no property of being truth
Truth lets us assent to sentences we can't explicitly exhibit
Inferential deflationism says truth has no essence because no unrestricted logic governs the concept
Deflationism skips definitions and models, and offers just accounts of basic laws of truth
Deflationism concerns the nature and role of truth, but not its laws
Deflationism says truth isn't a topic on its own - it just concerns what is true
Deflation: instead of asserting a sentence, we can treat it as an object with the truth-property
This deflationary account says truth has a role in generality, and in inference
Deflating the correspondence theory doesn't entail deflating all the other theories
Deflationism isn't a theory of truth, but an account of its role in natural language
Deflationist truth is an infinitely disjunctive property
Deflationists say truth merely serves to express infinite conjunctions
Deflationism says truth is a disquotation device to express generalisations, adding no new knowledge
Deflationists say truth is just for expressing infinite conjunctions or generalisations
The main problem for deflationists is they can express generalisations, but not prove them
Some say deflationism is axioms which are conservative over the base theory
Compositional Truth CT proves generalisations, so is preferred in discussions of deflationism
Deflationary theories reject analysis of truth in terms of truth-conditions
Someone who says 'it is day' proposes it is day, and it is true if it is day
Truth is the property of propositions that makes it possible to deduce facts
Without the disquotation device for truth, you could never form beliefs from others' testimony
Minimalism is incoherent, as it implies that truth both is and is not a property
Maybe there is no more to be said about 'true' than there is about the function of 'and' in logic
Instances of minimal truth miss out propositions inexpressible in current English
Minimal theories of truth avoid ontological commitment to such things as 'facts' or 'reality'
How can you investigate without some preconception of your object?
We must observe in order to form theories, but connected observations need prior theories
In physical sciences particular observations are ordered, but in biology only the classes are ordered
A full understanding of 'yellow' involves some theory
Seeing electrons in a cloud chamber requires theory
The inference to observables and unobservables is almost the same, so why distinguish them?
If theories need observation, and observations need theories, how do we start?
Demonstration starts from a definition of essence, so we can derive (or conjecture about) the properties
Aristotle gets asymmetric consequence from demonstration, which reflects real causal priority
Aristotle doesn't actually apply his theory of demonstration to his practical science
We can know by demonstration, which is a scientific deduction leading to understanding
Premises must be true, primitive and immediate, and prior to and explanatory of conclusions
A demonstration is a deduction which proceeds from necessities
Demonstrative understanding rests on necessary features of the thing in itself
Demonstrations must be necessary, and that depends on the middle term
All demonstration is concerned with existence, axioms and properties
Demonstrations are syllogisms which give explanations
Universal demonstrations are about thought; particular demonstrations lead to perceptions
Demonstration is better with fewer presuppositions, and it is quicker if these are familiar
The principles of demonstrations are definitions
There must be definitions before demonstration is possible
Aim to get definitions of the primitive components, thus establishing the kind, and work towards the attributes
There cannot be a science of accidentals, but only of general truths
Demonstrations about particulars must be about everything of that type
Demonstration derives what is less clear from what is clear
Induction is not demonstration, because not all of the instances can be observed
If each inference slightly reduced our certainty, science would soon be in trouble
Inductive inference is not proof, but weighing evidence and probability
We infer from evidence by working out what would explain that evidence
Demonstration provides depth of understanding and explanation (rather than foundations)
In demonstration, the explanatory order must mirror the causal order of the phenomena
In a demonstration the middle term explains, by being part of the definition
Science moves up and down between inventions of causes, and experiments
Nature is revealed when we put it under pressure rather than observe it
Only experiments can settle disagreements between rival explanations
Science is common sense, with a sophisticated method
Reports of experiments eliminate the experimenter, and present results as the behaviour of nature
An experiment is a test, or an adventure, or a diagnosis, or a dissection
We can deliberately cause ourselves to have true thoughts - hence the value of experiments
Interrogation and experiment submit us to having beliefs caused
Participation in an experiment requires agreement about what the outcome will mean
An experiment is a deliberate version of what informal thinking does all the time
Not all sciences are experimental; astronomy relies on careful observation
Randomised Control Trials have a treatment and a control group, chosen at random
Maybe an experiment unmasks an essential disposition, and reveals its regularities
Experiments don't just observe; they look to see what interventions change the natural order
Successful prediction shows proficiency in nature
Explanatory facts also predict, and predictive facts also explain
Correlations can provide predictions, but only causes can give explanations
Most predictions are uninteresting, and are only sought in order to confirm a theory
Unpredictability doesn't entail inexplicability, and predictability doesn't entail explicability
The 'symmetry thesis' says explanation and prediction only differ pragmatically
It is more impressive that relativity predicted Mercury's orbit than if it had accommodated it
Predictions are best for finding explanations, because mere accommodations can be fudged
Explanation does not entail prediction
The possibility of prediction rests on determinism
A good barometer will predict a storm, but not explain it
If we say where Mars was two months ago, we offer an explanation without a prediction
Explanation predicts after the event; prediction explains before the event
Predictions give the 'content' of theories, which can then be 'equivalent' or 'adequate'
The theory of evolution was accepted because it explained, not because of its predictions
What matters is whether a theory can predict - not whether it actually does so
If a theory can be fudged, so can observations
A system can infer the structure of the world by making predictions about it
If the apparent facts strongly conflict with probability, it is in everyone's interests to suppress the facts
Inductive generalisation is more reliable than one of its instances; they can't all be wrong
We can save laws from counter-instances by treating the latter as analytic definitions
All theories contain anomalies, and so are falsified!
The anomaly of Uranus didn't destroy Newton's mechanics - it led to Neptune's discovery
Anomalies are judged against rival theories, and support for the current theory
Anomalies challenge the claim that the basic explanations are actually basic
A single counterexample is enough to prove that a truth is not necessary
If a proposition implies any false consequences, then it is false
Observation can force rejection of some part of the initial set of claims
We only discard a hypothesis after one failure if it appears likely to keep on failing
Kuhn's scientists don't aim to falsifying their paradigm, because that is what they rely on
Most theories are continually falsified
Particulars can be verified or falsified, but general statements can only be falsified (conclusively)
Give Nobel Prizes for really good refutations?
Falsification is the criterion of demarcation between science and non-science
We don't only reject hypotheses because we have falsified them
If falsification requires logical inconsistency, then probabilistic statements can't be falsified
When Popper gets in difficulties, he quietly uses induction to help out
Unfalsifiability may be a failure in an empirical theory, but it is a virtue in metaphysics
A proposition such as 'some swans are purple' cannot be falsified, only verified
The discoverers of Neptune didn't change their theory because of an anomaly
Science mostly aims at confirming theories, rather than falsifying them
Why abandon a theory if you don't have a better one?
If a theory is more informative it is less probable
Falsificationism would be naive if even a slight discrepancy in evidence killed a theory
Smoking disposes towards cancer; smokers without cancer do not falsify this claim
Plato says sciences are unified around Forms; Aristotle says they're unified around substance
General statements about nature are not valid
Duns Scotus offers perhaps the best logic and metaphysics for modern physical science
I classify science by level of abstraction; principles derive from above, and data from below
The building blocks contain the whole contents of a discipline
There is no one scientific method; we must try many approaches, and many emotions
Mathematically expressed propositions are true of the world, but how to interpret them?
Carnap tried to define all scientific predicates in terms of primitive relations, using type theory
Two theories can be internally consistent and match all the facts, yet be inconsistent with one another
It seems obvious to prefer the simpler of two theories, on grounds of beauty and convenience
There are four suspicious reasons why we prefer simpler theories
Kuhn came to accept that all scientists agree on a particular set of values
Since there are three different dimensions for generalising laws, no one system of logic can cover them
Identities like 'heat is molecule motion' are necessary (in the highest degree), not contingent
Clavius's Paradox: purely syntactic entailment theories won't explain, because they are too profuse
Simplicity can sort theories out, but still leaves an infinity of possibilities
The powers/natures approach has been so successful (for electricity, magnetism, gravity) it may be universal
Social sciences discover no law-like generalisations, and tend to ignore counterexamples
Why should it matter whether or not a theory is scientific?
Theories can never represent accurately, because their components are abstract
Theories are links in the causal chain between the environment and our beliefs
If we make a hypothesis about data, then a deduction, where does the hypothesis come from?
If the world is theory-dependent, the theories themselves can't be theory-dependent
Neither a priori rationalism nor sense data empiricism account for scientific knowledge
The Principle of Conservatism says we should violate the minimum number of background beliefs
Relativity ousted Newtonian mechanics despite a loss of simplicity
Realists say their theories involve truth and the existence of their phenomena
There is no agreement on scientific method - because there is no such thing
How can we mathematically describe a world that lacks humans?
Seeing reality mathematically makes it an object of thought, not of experience
Theories with unobservables are underdetermined by the evidence
Is Newton simpler with universal simultaneity, or Einstein simpler without absolute time?
Structural Realism says mathematical structures persist after theory rejection
Structural Realists must show the mathematics is both crucial and separate
Vertical arguments say eliminate a term if it picks out different natural kinds in different theories
Horizontal arguments say eliminate a term if it fails to pick out a natural kind
If a term doesn't pick out a kind, keeping it may block improvements in classification
Science begins with sufficient reason, de-animation, and the importance of nature
Science must clear away the idols of the mind if they are ever going to find the truth
Theories are practical tools for progress, not answers to enigmas
Science aims to find uniformities to which (within the limits of experience) there are no exceptions
Good theories have empirical content, explain a lot, and are not falsified
Science aims at truth, not at 'simplicity'
Science aims to explain things, not just describe them
Science investigates the nature and constitution of things or substances
We prefer the theory which explains and predicts the powers and capacities of particulars
To accept a scientific theory, we only need to believe that it is empirically adequate
Science is sometimes said to classify powers, neglecting qualities
We want illuminating theories, rather than coherent theories
A theory need not be true to be good; it should just be true about its physical aspects
A theory which doesn't fit nature is unexplanatory, even if it is true
Empiricist theories are sets of laws, which give explanations and reductions
Science has to abstract out the subjective attributes of things, focusing on what is objective
Pragmatism says all theories are instrumental - that is, mental modes of adaptation to reality
True thoughts are just valuable instruments of action
Special relativity, unlike general relativity, was operationalist in spirit
All linguistic forms in science are merely judged by their efficiency as instruments
The 'Tractatus' is instrumentalist about laws of nature
Users of digital thermometers recognise no temperatures in the gaps
For Quine, theories are instruments used to make predictions about observations
For the instrumentalists there are no scientific explanations
Naïve operationalism would have meanings change every time the tests change
Instrumentalism normally says some discourse is useful, but not genuinely true
Operationalism defines concepts by our ways of measuring them
Instrumentalists regard theories as tools for prediction, with truth being irrelevant
Theories aren't just for organising present experience if they concern the past or future
For most scientists their concepts are not just useful, but are meant to be true and accurate
Scientific thought is essentially a specialised part of Indo-European languages
Switching scientific paradigms is a conversion experience
Concepts are superior because they make us more aware, and change our thinking
The periodic system is the big counterexample to Kuhn's theory of revolutionary science
Many different theories will fit the observed facts
Two goods may be comparable, although they are not commensurable
We lack frames of reference to transform physics, biology and psychology into one another
Kuhn has a description theory of reference, so the reference of 'electron' changes with the descriptions
Incommensurability assumes concepts get their meaning from within the theory
Galileo's notions can't be 'incommensurable' if we can fully describe them
In theory change, words shift their natural reference, so the theories are incommensurable
If theories are really incommensurable, we could believe them all
One may understand a realm of ideas, but be unable to judge their rationality or truth
Two things can't be incompatible if they are incommensurable
If you changed one of Newton's concepts you would destroy his whole system
Experiments only test groups of hypotheses, and can't show which one is wrong
Statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience as a corporate body
For Feyerabend the meaning of a term depends on a whole theory
The models we use in reasoning may be more like perceptions than like language
In the 'received view' models are formal; the 'semantic view' emphasises representation
Theoretical models can represent, by mapping onto the data-models
Representational success in models depends on success of their explanations
The best model of the atomic nucleus is the one which explains the most results
'Model' belongs in a family of concepts, with representation, idealisation and abstraction
Models are theory-driven, or phenomenological (more empirical and specific)
Mental terms can be replaced in a sentence by a variable and an existential quantifier
There is a method for defining new scientific terms just using the terms we already understand
A Ramsey sentence just asserts that a theory can be realised, without saying by what
It is better to have one realisation of a theory than many - but it may not always be possible
The Ramsey sentence of a theory says that it has at least one realisation
If I used ramsey sentences to eliminate fundamentality from my theory, that would be a real loss
The Ramsey-sentence approach preserves observations, but eliminates unobservables
The Ramsey sentence describes theoretical entities; it skips reference, but doesn't eliminate
Nobody fears a disease which nobody has yet caught
Induction is the progress from particulars to universals
Even simple facts are hard to believe at first hearing
Science deduces propositions from phenomena, and generalises them by induction
The idea of inductive evidence, around 1660, made Hume's problem possible
The whole theory of induction rests on causes
Mill's methods (Difference,Agreement,Residues,Concomitance,Hypothesis) don't nail induction
Induction is merely psychological, with a principle that it can actually establish laws
In science one observation can create high probability, while a thousand might prove nothing
If you eliminate the impossible, the truth will remain, even if it is weird
Induction relies on similar effects following from each cause
Induction is just more of the same: animal expectations
Enumerative induction is inference to the best explanation
Brains are essentially anticipation machines
Induction is repetition, instances, deduction, probability or causation
If we only use induction to assess induction, it is empirically indefeasible, and hence a priori
Enumerative induction gives a universal judgement, while statistical induction gives a proportion
The problem of induction is how to justify our belief in the uniformity of nature
Inductive success is rewarded with more induction
Induction leaps into the unknown, but usually lands safely
Induction is said to just compare properties of categories, but the type of property also matters
Induction is reasoning from the observed to the unobserved
Induction is inferences from examined to unexamined instances of a given kind
Psychologists use 'induction' as generalising a property from one category to another
'Ampliative' induction infers that all members of a category have a feature found in some of them
If causation were necessary, the past would fix the future, and induction would be simple
The only full uniformities in nature occur from the essences of fundamental things
We learn universals from many particulars
Science is based on induction, for general truths about fire, rhubarb and magnets
Hypotheses come from induction, which is comparison of experiences
We assume similar secret powers behind similar experiences, such as the nourishment of bread
'Induction' doesn't capture Greek 'epagoge', which is singulars in a mass producing the general
Induction is inferring premises from consequences
Induction accepts the simplest law that fits our experiences
The induction problem is to prove generalisations about the future based on the past
Induction passes from particular facts to other particulars, or to general laws, non-deductively
More careful inductions gradually lead to the hypothetico-deductive method
Induction is an attempt to increase the coherence of our explanations
Induction is just reasonable methods of inferring the unobserved from the observed
Induction must go beyond the evidence, in order to explain why the evidence occurred
Induction is inference to the best explanation, where the explanation is a law
We say 'so in cases of this kind', but how do you decide what is 'of this kind'?
From the fact that some men die, we cannot infer that they all do
If you don't view every particular, you may miss the one which disproves your universal induction
The instances confirming a general truth are never enough to establish its necessity
Reason cannot show why reliable past experience should extend to future times and remote places
Induction can't prove that the future will be like the past, since induction assumes this
Fools, children and animals all learn from experience
If we infer causes from repetition, this explains why we infer from a thousand objects what we couldn't infer from one
All inferences from experience are effects of custom, not reasoning
How does induction get started?
Induction can never prove that laws have no exceptions
The worst fallacy in induction is generalising one recondite property from a sample
Chickens are not very good at induction, and are surprised when their feeder wrings their neck
It doesn't follow that because the future has always resembled the past, that it always will
We can't prove induction from experience without begging the question
We can't use the uniformity of nature to prove induction, as that would be circular
There is no such thing as induction
Induction aims at 'all Fs', but abduction aims at hidden or theoretical entities
If events are unconnected, then induction cannot be solved
Induction is 'defeasible', since additional information can invalidate it
Conjunctions explain nothing, and so do not give a reason for confidence in inductions
Hume's atomic events makes properties independent, and leads to problems with induction
Standard induction does not allow for vertical inferences, to some unobservable lower level
Children overestimate the power of a single example
Children make errors in induction by focusing too much on categories
The first million numbers confirm that no number is greater than a million
Anything justifying inferences from observed to unobserved must itself do that
If Hume is right about induction, there is no scientific knowledge
Hume's question is whether experimental science will still be valid tomorrow
Maybe induction is only reliable IF reality is stable
Nature is not completely uniform, and some regular causes sometimes fail to produce their effects
Induction moves from some truths to similar ones, by contraries or consequents
Premises can support an argument without entailing it
Hume just shows induction isn't deduction
Science cannot be shown to be rational if induction is rejected
Good induction needs 'total evidence' - the absence at the time of any undermining evidence
All reasoning is inductive, and deduction only concerns implication
Observed regularities are only predictable if we assume hidden necessity
An inductive inference is underdetermined, by definition
We can argue to support our beliefs, so induction will support induction, for believers in induction
Induction (unlike deduction) is non-monotonic - it can be invalidated by new premises
How can an argument be good induction, but poor deduction?
Inductive defences of induction may be rule-circular, but not viciously premise-circular
Goodman argued that the confirmation relation can never be formalised
Goodman showed that every sound inductive argument has an unsound one of the same form
Grue and green won't be in the same world, as that would block induction entirely
Grue is a puzzle because the notions of similarity and kind are dubious in science
Unlike 'green', the 'grue' predicate involves a time and a change
Science suggests that the predicate 'grue' is not a genuine single universal
Emeralds are naturally green, and only an external force could turn them blue
'Grue' introduces a new causal hypothesis - that emeralds can change colour
The grue problem shows that natural kinds are central to science
Grueness is not, unlike green and blue, associated with causal potential
'Grue' only has causal features because of its relation to green
To just expect unexamined emeralds to be grue would be totally unreasonable
Observing lots of green x can confirm 'all x are green' or 'all x are grue', where 'grue' is arbitrary
Predictions are bound to be arbitrary if they depend on the language used
Problem predicates in induction don't reflect the structure of nature
Two applications of 'grue' do not guarantee a similarity between two things
Any conclusion can be drawn from an induction, if we use grue-like predicates
Several months of observing beech trees supports the deciduous and evergreen hypotheses
We normally learn natural kinds from laws, but Goodman shows laws require prior natural kinds
'Grue' is not a colour
Read 'all ravens are black' as about ravens, not as about an implication
The raven paradox has three disjuncts, confirmed by confirming any one of them
It is because ravens are birds that their species and their colour might be connected
Non-black non-ravens just aren't part of the presuppositions of 'all ravens are black'
Contraposition may be equivalent in truth, but not true in nature, because of irrelevant predicates
The items put forward by the contraposition belong within different natural clusters
The possibility that all ravens are black is a law depends on a mechanism producing the blackness
If something in ravens makes them black, it may be essential (definitive of ravens)
My shoes are not white because they lack some black essence of ravens
A theory may explain the blackness of a raven, but say nothing about the whiteness of shoes
We can't turn non-black non-ravens into ravens, to test the theory
To pick a suitable contrast to ravens, we need a hypothesis about their genes
'All x are y' is equivalent to 'all non-y are non-x', so observing paper is white confirms 'ravens are black'
If sentences point to different evidence, they must have different subject-matter
Most people say nonblack nonravens do confirm 'all ravens are black', but only a tiny bit
Observing irrelevant items supports both 'all x are y' and 'all x are non-y', revealing its absurdity
The probability of two events is the first probability times the second probability assuming the first
Ramsey gave axioms for an uncertain agent to decide their preferences
Instead of gambling, Jeffrey made the objects of Bayesian preference to be propositions
Probabilities can only be assessed relative to some evidence
Probability of H, given evidence E, is prob(H) x prob(E given H) / prob(E)
Bayes' theorem explains why very surprising predictions have a higher value as evidence
Bayes is too liberal, since any logical consequence of a hypothesis confirms it
A hypothesis is confirmed if an unlikely prediction comes true
Bayes seems to rule out prior evidence, since that has a probability of one
Bayes involves 'prior' probabilities, 'likelihood', 'posterior' probability, and 'conditionalising'
Explanation may be an important part of implementing Bayes's Theorem
Since every tautology has a probability of 1, should we believe all tautologies?
Bayesian inference is forced to rely on approximations
Bayes produces weird results if the prior probabilities are bizarre
Bayesianism claims to find rationality and truth in induction, and show how science works
If the rules only concern changes of belief, and not the starting point, absurd views can look ratiional
Probability supports Bayesianism better as degrees of belief than as ratios of frequencies
Aristotelian explanations are facts, while modern explanations depend on human conceptions
What is most universal is furthest away, and the particulars are nearest
Universals are valuable because they make the explanations plain
Are particulars explained more by universals, or by other particulars?
Universal principles are not primary beings, but particular principles are not universally knowable
All knowledge and explanation rests on the inexplicable
Surprisingly, empiricists before Mill ignore explanation, which seems to transcend experience
Explanations have states of affairs as their objects
Explanations typically relate statements, not events
Explanatory exclusion: there cannot be two separate complete explanations of a single event
Hume allows interpolation, even though it and extrapolation are not actually valid
Usually explanations just involve giving information, with no reference to the act of explanation
Explanation may describe induction, but may not show how it justifies, or leads to truth
Explanations must cite generalisations
People tend to be satisfied with shallow explanations
The objective component of explanations is the things that must exist for the explanation
We talk both of 'people' explaining things, and of 'facts' explaining things
'Because' can signal an inference rather than an explanation
A good explanation totally rules out the opposite explanation (so Forms are required)
We know a thing if we grasp its first causes, principles and basic elements
What we seek and understand are facts, reasons, existence, and identity
Explanation is of the status of a thing, inferences to it, initiation of change, and purpose
Understanding moves from the less to the more intelligible
Explanation is generally to deduce it from something better known, which comes in degrees
Explanation is just showing the succession of things ever more clearly
Good explications are exact, fruitful, simple and similar to the explicandum
Explanation gives understanding by revealing the full multiplicity of the thing
Explanation and understanding are the same
Scientific explanation aims at a unifying account of underlying structures and processes
Scientific explanation is not reducing the unfamiliar to the familiar
Why-questions can seek evidence as well as explanation
Only changes require explanation
Audience-relative explanation, or metaphysical explanation based on information?
Explanation is for curiosity, control, understanding, to make meaningful, or to give authority
Does a good explanation produce understanding? That claim is just empty
An explanation gives the reason the phenomenon occurred
An explanation is what makes the unfamiliar familiar to us
An explanation is what is added to knowledge to yield understanding
Seaching for explanations is a good way to discover the structure of the world
If all possibilities are equal, order seems (a priori) to need an explanation - or does it?
An explanation presupposes something that is improbable unless it is explained
We can't reject all explanations because of a regress; inexplicable A can still explain B
Scientists eventually seek underlying explanations for every pattern
A good explanation captures the real-world dependence among the phenomena
The height of a flagpole could be fixed by its angle of shadow, but that would be very unusual
Universe expansion explains the red shift, but not vice versa
If explanation is by entailment, that lacks a causal direction, unlike natural necessity
Powers can explain the direction of causality, and make it a natural necessity
An explanation needs the world to have an appropriate structure
If the flagpole causally explains the shadow, the shadow cannot explain the flagpole
Natural science seeks explanation; human sciences seek understanding
Nature requires causal explanations, but society requires clarification by reasons and motives
The behaviour of persons and social groups seems to need rational rather than causal explanation
Four Explanations: the essence and form; the matter; the source; and the end
Aristotle's four 'causes' are four items which figure in basic explanations of nature
There are as many causes/explanations as there are different types of why-question
Science refers the question Why? to four causes/explanations: matter, form, source, purpose
Aristotle's standard analysis of species and genus involves specifying things in terms of something more general
Aristotelian explanations mainly divide things into natural kinds
To the four causes Plato adds a fifth, the idea which guided the event
Nature is explained by mathematics and mechanism, but the laws rest on metaphysics
The four explanations: objects by causes, concepts by ground, maths by spacetime, ethics by motive
Analytic explanation is wholes in terms of parts; synthetic is parts in terms of wholes or contexts
An explanation is a table of statistical information
The 'inferential' conception is that all scientific explanations are arguments
Ontic explanations can be facts, or reports of facts
The three basic conceptions of scientific explanation are modal, epistemic, and ontic
A good reason for something (the smoke) is not an explanation of it (the fire)
An explanation is often a deduction, but that may well beg the question
Follow maths for necessary truths, and jurisprudence for contingent truths
Two main types of explanation are by causes, or by citing a theoretical framework
Most explanations are just sentences, not arguments
Beneath every extrinsic explanation there is an intrinsic explanation
Is there metaphysical explanation (as well as causal), involving a constitutive form of determination?
We explain by identity (what it is), or by truth (how things are)
Nomothetic explanations cite laws, and structural explanations cite mechanisms
Explanation is either showing predictability, or showing necessity, or showing causal relations
Explanations are causal, nomic, psychological, psychoanalytic, Darwinian or functional
Evolutionary explanations look to the past or the group, not to the individual
Value, constitution and realisation are non-causal dependences that explain
If explanations track dependence, then 'determinative' explanations seem to exist
Two things being identical (like water and H2O) is not an explanation
There are 'conceptual' explanations, with their direction depending on complexity
Explanations by disposition are more stable and reliable than those be external circumstances
Grounding is a kind of explanation, suited to metaphysics
In 'contrastive' explanation there is a fact and a foil - why that fact, rather than this foil?
With too many causes, find a suitable 'foil' for contrast, and the field narrows right down
Contrastive explanations say why one thing happened but not another
Explaining 'Adam ate the apple' depends on emphasis, and thus implies a contrast
Explanation of a fact is fitting it into a system of beliefs
Explanations are bad by fitting badly with a web of beliefs, or fitting well into a bad web
Deducing from laws is one possible way to achieve a coherent explanation
Good explanations unify
An explanation is a model that fits a theory and predicts the phenomenological laws
An explanation unifies a phenomenon with our account of other phenomena
We can go beyond mere causal explanations if we believe in an 'order of being'
1: Coherence is a symmetrical relation between two propositions
2: An explanation must wholly cohere internally, and with the new fact
3: If an analogous pair explain another analogous pair, then they all cohere
4: For coherence, observation reports have a degree of intrinsic acceptability
5: Contradictory propositions incohere
6: A proposition's acceptability depends on its coherence with a system
We explain by deriving the properties of a phenomenon by embedding it in a large abstract theory
Consilience is a common groundwork of explanation
An explanation is better if it also explains phenomena from a different field
Consilience makes the component sciences more likely
Chance is inexplicable, because we can only explain what happens always or usually
Explanation and generality are inseparable
Facts should be deducible from the theory and initial conditions, and prefer the simpler theory
Positivism explains facts by connecting particular phenomena with general facts
Explanation is fitting of facts into ever more general patterns of regularity
We give a mathematical account of a system of natural connections in order to clarify them
The modern worldview is based on the illusion that laws explain nature
For Hempel, explanations are deductive-nomological or probabilistic-statistical
The covering-law model is for scientific explanation; historical explanation is quite different
We must distinguish true laws because they (unlike accidental generalizations) explain things
Deductive-nomological explanations will predict, and their predictions will explain
A law is not enough for explanation - we need information about what makes a difference
To explain observations by a regular law is to explain the observations by the observations
Science may well pursue generalised explanation, rather than laws
Laws get the facts wrong, and explanation rests on improvements and qualifications of laws
Laws apply to separate domains, but real explanations apply to intersecting domains
The covering law view assumes that each phenomenon has a 'right' explanation
Covering-law explanation lets us explain storms by falling barometers
I disagree with the covering-law view that there is a law to cover every single case
You can't explain one quail's behaviour by just saying that all quails do it
Deduction explanation is too easy; any law at all will imply the facts - together with the facts!
Good explanations may involve no laws and no deductions
We reject deductive explanations if they don't explain, not if the deduction is bad
The explanation is not the regularity, but the activity sustaining it
General laws depend upon the capacities of particulars, not the other way around
Just citing a cause does not enable us to understand an event; we also need a relevant law
The 'covering law model' says only laws can explain the occurrence of single events
If laws explain the length of a flagpole's shadow, then the shadow also explains the length of the pole
Laws should help explain the things they govern, or that manifest them
'Covering law' explanations only work if no other explanations are to be found
Livers always accompany hearts, but they don't explain hearts
Maybe an instance of a generalisation is more explanatory than the particular case
Generalisations must be invariant to explain anything
It is tempting to think that only entailment provides a full explanation
Mathematics can reveal structural similarities in diverse systems
To understand a phenomenon, we must understand why it is necessary, not merely contingent
Essentialists don't infer from some to all, but from essences to necessary behaviour
A good explanation is supposed to show that the event had to happen
An explanation shows why it was necessary that the effect occurred
Mathematics can show why some surprising events have to occur
Democritus was devoted to discovering causal explanations
To investigate the causes of things, study what is best for them
The foundation or source is stronger than the thing it causes
Geometrical proofs do not show causes, as when we prove a triangle contains two right angles
Science aims to show causes and generation of things
We should admit only enough causes to explain a phenomenon, and no more
Natural effects of the same kind should be assumed to have the same causes
Minds are best explained by their ends, and bodies by efficient causes
Causal inference is by spotting either Agreements or Differences
If scientific explanation is causal, that rules out mathematical explanation
Hempel rejects causation as part of explanation
Flagpoles explain shadows, and not vice versa, because of temporal ordering
Lewis endorses the thesis that all explanation of singular events is causal explanation
An explanation tells us how an event was caused
Often explanaton seeks fundamental laws, rather than causal histories
To explain an event is to provide some information about its causal history
The causal theory of explanation neglects determinations which are not causal
To explain is to give either the causal history, or the causal mechanism
Mathematical and philosophical explanations are not causal
A cause may not be an explanation
Causal inferences are clearest when we can manipulate things
Explanations may be easier to find than causes
Not all explanations are causal, but if a thing can be explained at all, it can be explained causally
There are non-causal explanations, most typically mathematical explanations
An explanation can just be a 'causal story', without laws, as when I knock over some ink
Natural explanations give the causal interconnections
An explanation is a causal graph
Not all explanation is causal. We don't explain a painting's beauty, or the irrationality of root-2, that way
Explanation of causal phenomena concerns essential kinds - but also lack of them
Greek uses the same word for 'cause' and 'explanation'
There are plenty of examples of non-causal explanation
Final causes can help with explanations in physics
To explain a house we must describe its use, as well as its parts
Functions are not properties of objects, they are activities contributing to mechanisms
Biological functions are explained by disposition, or by causal role
Galileo introduced geometrico-mechanical explanation, based on Archimedes
Explanation is deducing a phenomenon from some nature better known to us
A machine strikes us as being a rule of movement
Causation produces productive mechanisms; to understand the world, understand these mechanisms
Salmon's interaction mechanisms needn't be regular, or involving any systems
Explanation at the quantum level will probably be by entirely new mechanisms
Does an item have a function the first time it occurs?
Explanations reveal the mechanisms which produce the facts
Salmon's mechanisms are processes and interactions, involving marks, or conserved quantities
Explanations of particular events are not essentialist, as they don't reveal essential structures
The necessity of Newton's First Law derives from the nature of material things, not from a mechanism
If the nature of particulars explains their powers, it also explains their relations and behaviour
Powers and natures lead us to hypothesise underlying mechanisms, which may be real
We want to know not just the cause, but how the cause operated
Mechanisms are not just push-pull systems
A mechanism explains a phenomenon by showing how it was produced
Mechanisms are systems organised to produce regular change
Our account of mechanism combines both entities and activities
Descriptions of explanatory mechanisms have a bottom level, where going further is irrelevant
Modern mechanism need parts with spatial, temporal and function facts, and diagrams
Mechanisms are either systems of parts or sequences of activities
Mechanistic philosophy of science is an alternative to the empiricist law-based tradition
17th century mechanists explained everything by the kinetic physical fundamentals
Unlike the lawlike approach, mechanistic explanation can allow for exceptions
General theories may be too abstract to actually explain the mechanisms
We can show that regularities and pragmatic laws are more basic than mechanisms
Mechanisms can't explain on their own, as their models rest on pragmatic regularities
Mechanisms are ontologically dependent on regularities
Mechanisms must produce macro-level regularities, but that needs micro-level regularities
A structure won't give a causal explanation unless we know the powers of the structure
Using mechanisms as explanatory schemes began in chemistry
Thick mechanisms map whole reactions, and thin mechanism chart the steps
We observe qualities, and use 'induction' to refer to the substances lying under them
Science is the reduction of diverse forces and powers to a smaller number that explain them
You can only explain the qualities of large objects using entities which lack those qualities
Six reduction levels: groups, lives, cells, molecules, atoms, particles
Scientific explanation tends to reduce things to the unfamiliar (not the familiar)
Solidity comes from the power of repulsion, and shape from the power of attraction
We can explain by showing constitution, as well as showing causes
Reducing one science to another is often said to be the perfect explanation
Reductive explanation is not the be-all and the end-all of explanation
Grounding is an explanation of truth, and needs all the virtues of good explanations
One form of explanation is by decomposition
Best explanations, especially natural ones, need grounding, notably by persistent objects
Explanatory reduction is stronger than ontological reduction
Aristotelian explanation by essence may need to draw on knowledge of other essences
Aristotle regularly says that essential properties explain other significant properties
To understand a triangle summing to two right angles, we need to know the essence of a line
We know something when we fully know what it is, not just its quality, quantity or location
We know a thing when we grasp its essence
Real enquiries seek causes, and causes are essences
The explanation is what gives matter its state, which is the form, which is the substance
Essential properties explain in conjunction with properties shared by the same kind
Definition of essence makes things understandable
Forms make things distinct and explain the properties, by pure form, or arrangement of parts
To understand the properties we must know the essence, as with a circle
From the phenomena, I can't deduce the reason for the properties of gravity
Locke seems to use real essence for scientific explanation, and substratum for the being of a thing
To explain qualities, Locke invokes primary and secondary qualities, not real essences
Gold is supposed to have a real essence, from whence its detectable properties flow
To fully conceive the subject is to explain the resulting predicates and events
The cause of a change is not the real influence, but whatever gives a reason for the change
The essence of substance is the law of its changes, as in the series of numbers
We will only connect our various definitions of gold when we understand it more deeply
To give essentialist explanations there have to be natural kinds
Can the qualities of a body be split into two groups, where the smaller explains the larger?
Essence explains passive capacities as well as active powers
Some peripheral properties are explained by essential ones, but don't themselves explain properties
Some non-essential properties may explain more than essential-but-peripheral ones do
The category of substance is more important for epistemology than for ontology
Naming the secondary substance provides a mass of general information
Asking 'what is it?' nicely points us to the persistence of a continuing entity
If fragile just means 'breaks when dropped', it won't explain a breakage
Nuclear charge (plus laws) explains electron structure and spectrum, but not vice versa
Locke's kind essences are explanatory, without being necessary to the kind
Discovering the Aristotelian essence of thunder will tell us why thunder occurs
Bohr explained the periodic table and chemical properties of elements, using the quantum atom
Essences must explain, so we can infer them causally from the accidents
Essences are used to explain natural kinds, modality, and causal powers
Statistical explanation needs relevance, not high probability
Think of probabilities in terms of propensities rather than frequencies
Can events whose probabilities are low be explained?
If the well-ordering of a pack of cards was by shuffling, the explanation would make it more surprising
To maximise probability, don't go beyond your data
Probabilistic-statistical explanations don't entail the explanandum, but makes it more likely
An operation might reduce the probability of death, yet explain a death
Explanatory proofs rest on 'characterizing properties' of entities or structure
Reductio proofs do not seem to be very explanatory
Proof by cases (by 'exhaustion') is said to be unexplanatory
If inductive proofs hold because of the structure of natural numbers, they may explain theorems
Can a proof that no one understands (of the four-colour theorem) really be a proof?
Universals give better explanations, because they are self-explanatory and primitive
The Copernican theory is right because it is the only one offering a good explanation
The Methods of Difference and of Agreement are forms of inference to the best explanation
A false theory could hardly rival the explanatory power of natural selection
'Abduction' is beginning a hypothesis, particularly if it includes preference of one explanation over others
Abduction involves original suggestions, and not just the testing involved in induction
If the cat reappears in a new position, presumably it has passed through the intermediate positions
Belief in real objects makes our account of experience simpler and more systematic
If an explanation is good, the symbol is used properly in the future
Best explanations explain the most by means of the least
Best Explanation is the core notion of epistemology
Is Inference to the Best Explanation nothing more than inferring the likeliest cause?
Best Explanation as a guide to inference is preferable to best standard explanations
The 'likeliest' explanation is the best supported; the 'loveliest' gives the most understanding
IBE is inferring that the best potential explanation is the actual explanation
Finding the 'loveliest' potential explanation links truth to understanding
IBE is not passive treatment of data, but involves feedback between theory and data search
A contrasting difference is the cause if it offers the best explanation
We select possible explanations for explanatory reasons, as well as choosing among them
Abduction could have true data and a false conclusion, and may include data not originally mentioned
Scientific confirmation is best viewed as inference to the best explanation
The best theory has the highest subjective (Bayesian) probability?
Abduction aims at simplicity, testability, coherence and comprehensiveness
To see if an explanation is the best, it is necessary to investigate the alternative explanations
Inference to the Best Explanation is done with facts, so it has to be realist
The periodic table suggests accommodation to facts rates above prediction
The best explanations get down to primary basics, but others go less deep
Nature can be fully explained by final causes alone, or by efficient causes alone
If we find a hypothesis that explains many things, we conclude that it explains everything
Science does not aim at ultimate explanations
It's not at all clear that explanation needs to stop anywhere
Ultimate explanations are in 'grounds', which account for other truths, which hold in virtue of the grounding
There are four types of bottom-level activities which will explain phenomena
Subatomic particles may terminate explanation, if they lack structure
Maybe dispositions can replace the 'laws of nature' as the basis of explanation
To avoid a regress in explanations, ungrounded dispositions will always have to be posited
If the ultimate explanation is a list of entities, no laws, patterns or mechanisms can be cited
There is nothing wrong with an infinite regress of mechanisms and regularities
We should accept as explanations all the plausible ways in which something could come about
Why should the true explanation be one of the few we have actually thought of?
Inference to best explanation contains all sorts of hidden values
In science, best explanations have regularly turned out to be false
Must we only have one explanation, and must all the data be made relevant?
Bayesians say best explanations build up an incoherent overall position
The best theory is boring: compare 'all planets move elliptically' with 'most of them do'
Best explanation can't be a guide to truth, because the truth must precede explanation
The success and virtue of an explanation do not guarantee its truth
Which explanation is 'best' is bound to be subjective, and no guide to truth
Maybe bad explanations are the true ones, in this messy world
Explanations are mind-dependent, theory-laden, and interest-relative
You can't decide which explanations are good if you don't attend to the interest-relative aspects
An explanation is just descriptive information answering a particular question
We accept many scientific theories without endorsing them as true
Facts explain facts, but only if they are conceptualised or named appropriately
Ontology is unrelated to explanation, which concerns modes of presentation and states of knowledge
Maybe explanation is entirely relative to the interests and presuppositions of the questioner
An explanation is the removal of the surprise caused by the event
Maybe explanation is so subjective that it cannot be a part of science
Men often answer inner 'whys' by treating unconscious instincts as if they were reasons
Any explanation will be accepted as true if it gives pleasure and a feeling of power
